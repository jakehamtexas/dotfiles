Use Arch Wiki
When writing hostname, set '127.0.0.1 localhost' in /etc/hosts
When using pacstrap, add these packages:
iwd nvim wget git zsh curl zip unzip tar man-db man-pages texinfo sudo

When doing EFI
	- bootctl was the least difficult
	- don't forgot to add an entry for the kernel
	- cat /etc/fstab for UUID of root fs partition
